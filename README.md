# Heart Attack Indicators: Visualization and Model Comparison

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze heart attack indicators using various visualization techniques and compare the performance of several classification models. The dataset includes various health-related features and the occurrence of heart attacks, among other health conditions. The analysis involves understanding the data, preprocessing, visualizing, and evaluating different classification models to identify the best approach for predicting heart attacks.

## Project Steps

1. **Understanding the Data**
   - Loading and exploring the dataset.
   - Checking for null values and handling them using a suitable strategy (e.g., removing or imputing).

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
   - Visualizing the distribution of key features and the target variable.
   - Analyzing correlations between features.
   - Creating informative plots to understand data patterns.

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Scaling features where necessary.
   - Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
   - Performing feature selection using the Chi-Squared test.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Training several classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Comparing model performance with and without scaling.
   - Evaluating models with SMOTE and feature selection.
   - Collecting and comparing model metrics in a data frame to identify the best performing model.

## Functions
   - The notebook includes several ready-to-use functions that simplify the coding process for creating and evaluating the model.

## Model Comparison

A summary of the performance of various models is provided in a data frame, allowing for easy comparison and selection of the best model based on different metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
